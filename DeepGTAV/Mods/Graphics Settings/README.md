In the two subdirectories you can see screenshots of the graphics settings that were used to capture different datasets. `GraphicsSettingsBestCaptureVisDrone` represents the best possible graphics settings, while `GraphicsSettingsLowCaptureVisDrone` shows the lowest possible graphics settings (keeping the same resolution and visual range).
