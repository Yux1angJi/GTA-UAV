# We differ between 'frame' and 'screenResolution', where frame is the
# resolution of the depth/stencil buffer, while screenResolution is the
# resolution at which the game is finally displayed on the screen.

# I believe the following statements to be correct, but it is only
# tested for resolutions of 1920x1080, 3840x2160 and 3840x2160DSR. For
# resolutions smaller than 1920x1080 frame and screenResolution are the
# same. For larger resolutions the buffers have a resolution of 1/4 of
# the screen. E.g. when rendering the game with DSR at 16k (7680x4320),
# the buffers are at 4k (3840x2160) while the screenResolution is
# downsized to match the screen (in this case 4k).
